## Mathematical Unification

The system achieves unification through the master equation:

```
∂Ψ/∂t = J_A000081(Ψ) · ∇H_A000081(Ψ) + R_echo(Ψ, T) + M_membrane(Ψ, T) + F_feedback(Ψ, T)
```

Where each term represents:
1. **J_A000081(Ψ) · ∇H_A000081(Ψ)**: Gradient flow on J-surface with A000081-derived structure
2. **R_echo(Ψ, T)**: Echo state reservoir dynamics with tree connectivity
3. **M_membrane(Ψ, T)**: P-system membrane evolution with planted trees
